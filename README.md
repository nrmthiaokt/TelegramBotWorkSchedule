# Telegram Bot Work Schedule
## What is Telegram Bot Work Schedule?
Telegram Bot Work Schedule is an integration system of Telegram with Google Sheet to help collect and inform employee daily work schedule attendance or work status data. By using this system, users can input data and retrieve data quickly via Telegram chat.

## Features
### Input Data
This feature allows users to enter data into Google Sheet via Telegram Bot, by typing the data you want to enter according to the format, then the data will automatically be inputted into Google Sheet.
### Retrieve Data Manually
This feature allows users to receive pre-input data via Telegram Bot messages. Users first type in the type of information they want to know, for example in this case a date, according to a predetermined format. Then the Telegram Bot will reply to the message by sending the information requested by the user.
### Retrieve Data Automatically
Just like manual data retrieval, this feature can also retrieve data from Google Sheets via Telegram Bot. However, with the addition that users do not need to type in the desired type of information. In this feature, users will receive Telegram Bot messages containing data that has been inputted previously on a scheduled basis, at predetermined times, in this case every day. The program will automatically send the data on the date that the input is entered by the user.
